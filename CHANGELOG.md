## 1.188.1
### Fixed

## 1.188.0
### Fixed
- Improved startup performance by 80%

### Updated
- M187 schema
- `azure-pipelines.customSchemaFile` can now point to a remote URL, as long as it does not require authentication
- Declared "limited" support for untrusted workspaces (all features will work except for `azure-pipelines.customSchemaFile`)

## 1.183.0
### Breaking change
- Configuration namespace has moved. If you added `customSchemaFile` or had keybindings to commands, you'll need to update your config. Wherever it says `[azure-pipelines].thing`, it should now read `azure-pipelines.thing`. And if you assigned a keybinding to `configure-pipeline`, change it to `azure-pipelines.configure-pipeline` instead. Sorry for the inconvenience, but this fixes several bugs and yields a better config experience. (Thanks @50Wliu!)

### Fixed
- Extension readme points to correct branch (thanks @AtOMiCNebula!)
- Several dependabot alerts
